### Definition: Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf)

For any random variable \(X\), the **cdf** is
\[
F_X(t) = \Pr(X \le t).
\]

This single function determines probabilities of all events that can be expressed in terms of \(X\).

---

### From Events to the CDF

For real numbers \(a \le b\),
\[
\Pr(a < X \le b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a).
\]

(Other combinations of strict/weak inequalities give the same value for continuous \(X\); for discrete \(X\) they may differ by point masses.)

A useful identity for discrete points is
\[
\Pr(X = x) = F_X(x) - F_X(x-0),
\]
where \(F_X(x-0)\) is the left limit of \(F_X\) at \(x\).

### Properties of Every CDF

1. **Non-decreasing:** if \(t_1 < t_2\), then \(F_X(t_1) \le F_X(t_2)\).\

2. **Limits:** \(\displaystyle \lim_{t\to -\infty}F_X(t)=0,\quad \lim_{t\to \infty}F_X(t)=1.\)\

3. **Right-continuous:** \(\displaystyle \lim_{h\downarrow 0} F_X(t+h)=F_X(t).\)\
 -- right-continuous allows jumps but forbids - holes - when you approach from the right.

## Example: Dartboard CDF (Distance from the Bullseye)

A dart is thrown at a **circular dartboard** of radius \(R\). **Assume the dart always hits the board and,  conditional on a hit, the landing point is uniformly distributed over the face of the board** (i.e., any two regions of equal area are equally likely to be hit).

Let \(X\) be the **distance from the dart's landing point to the bullseye (center)**.

**Task:** Derive the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of \(X\), namely
\[
F_X(t) = \Pr(X \le t),
\]
for all real \(t\).

### Solution

Because the hit is **uniform over area**, probability is proportional to area.

1. **Event geometry**  
   - For \(0\le t\le R\), the event \(\{X\le t\}\) is a disk of radius \(t\).  
   - Area of that disk: \(\pi t^{2}\).  
   - Area of the whole board: \(\pi R^{2}\).

   Hence  
   \[
   \Pr(X\le t)=\frac{\pi t^{2}}{\pi R^{2}}=\left(\frac{t}{R}\right)^{2},\qquad 0\le t\le R.
   \]

2. **Outside the feasible range**
   - If \(t<0\): distances cannot be negative \(\;\Rightarrow\; F_X(t)=0\).  
   - If \(t>R\): the dart always lands within distance \(R\) \(\;\Rightarrow\; F_X(t)=1\).

#### Piecewise form

\[
\boxed{
F_X(t)=
\begin{cases}
0, & t<0,\\[6pt]
\left(\dfrac{t}{R}\right)^{2}, & 0\le t\le R,\\[10pt]
1, & t>R.
\end{cases}}
\]

### Example - Number of Heads in Three Tosses

Experiment: toss a fair coin three times, and record the face up at each trial.  
Random variable: \(X=\) total number of heads.



- There are \(2^3 = 8\) equally - likely outcome sequences.  
- Exactly one sequence has 0 heads (ttt) - \(1/8\).  
- Exactly one sequence has 3 heads (hhh) - \(1/8\).  
- \(\binom{3}{1}=3\) sequences have 1 head - \(3/8\).  
- \(\binom{3}{2}=3\) sequences have 2 heads - \(3/8\).

---

#### Building the cdf \(F_X(t)=\Pr(X\le t)\)

1. **\(t<0\)**  
   No outcome gives \(X<0\) - \(F_X(t)=0\).

2. **\(0\le t<1\)**  
   Only \(X=0\) satisfies \(X\le t\).  
   \[
   F_X(t)=\Pr(X=0)=\frac18.
   \]

3. **\(1\le t<2\)**  
   \(X\) can be 0 or 1.  
   \[
   F_X(t)=\Pr(X=0)+\Pr(X=1)=\frac18+\frac38=\frac12.
   \]

4. **\(2\le t<3\)**  
   \(X\) can be 0,1,2.  
   \[
   F_X(t)=\frac18+\frac38+\frac38=\frac78.
   \]

5. **\(t\ge 3\)**  
   All possibilities counted - \(F_X(t)=1\).

---

#### Resulting piecewise form

\[
\boxed{
F_X(t)=
\begin{cases}
0, & t<0,\\[4pt]
\dfrac18, & 0\le t<1,\\[10pt]
\dfrac12, & 1\le t<2,\\[10pt]
\dfrac78, & 2\le t<3,\\[10pt]
1, & t\ge 3.
\end{cases}}
\]

Each step height equals the probability at that \(x\); cumulative sums give the cdf.
