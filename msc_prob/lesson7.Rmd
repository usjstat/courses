Each of the following activities focuses on understanding how a random variable maps from
the sample space to the real numbers, how events are expressed using
random variables, and how probabilities are computed using the induced
distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.2: Tossing a Die

A fair six-sided die is rolled once and the number showing on the top
face is observed.

Let $S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$.

Define the random variable 
$$
X(\omega) =
\begin{cases}
0 & \text{if } \omega \text{ is even} \\
1 & \text{if } \omega \text{ is odd}
\end{cases}
$$

1.  Write the range of $X$.\
2.  Express the event "an even number is rolled" in terms of $X$.\
3.  Find $\Pr(X = 0)$ and $\Pr(X = 1)$.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.3: Mapping Sample Space

A box contains 3 balls labeled Red (R), Green (G), and Blue (B). One
ball is drawn at random, and the color is observed.

Define 
$$
X(\omega) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \omega = R \\
2 & \text{if } \omega = G \\
3 & \text{if } \omega = B
\end{cases}
$$

1.  Define the sample space $S$.\
2.  Write the set $X(S)$.\
3.  Express the event that a ball drawn is not Green using $X$.\
4.  Compute $\Pr(X = 2)$.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.4: Qualitative to Quantitative Mapping

A survey is conducted where each person reports their favorite drink
among Tea (T), Coffee (C), or Juice (J). The responses are recorded from
4 individuals, one after the other, independently.

Define 
$$
X(\omega) = \text{number of people choosing Tea}
$$


1.  Give two possible outcomes from the sample space $S$.
2.  Write the sample space in set-builder notation.
3.  Write the range of $X$.\
4.  What is $X(T, T, J, C)$?\
5.  Express the event "exactly two people chose Tea" in terms of $X$.\
6.  Compute $\Pr(X = 2)$ assuming all outcomes are equally likely.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.5: Expressing Events via Random Variables

Two coins are tossed **simultaneously**. We observe the **sequence of
face-up outcomes** from both coins. Let H be the event that head is
observed and T be the event that tail is observed. Then, $H = \{h\}$ and
$T = \{t\}$

Let $S = \{hh, ht, th, tt\}$. 

Define 
$$
X(\omega) = \text{number of heads}
$$

1.  List values of $X(\omega)$ for each outcome.\
2.  Express "at least one head" using $X$.\
3.  Compute $\Pr(X = 1)$ and $\Pr(X \ge 1)$.


------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.6: Non-Numerical to Numerical Mapping

A quality control test is performed on a product in a factory. The
result of the test is recorded as one of the following outcomes: - Pass
(P) - Defect (D) - Missing Part (M)

Define 
$$
X(\omega) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \omega = P \\
2 & \text{if } \omega = D \\
3 & \text{if } \omega = M
\end{cases}
$$

1.  What is the range of $X$?\
2.  Consider the complement of the event \`\`pass'' is considered as
    "fail''. Write the event that a randomly selected product failed using $X$.\
3.  Given: $\Pr(P) = 0.8, \Pr(D) = 0.1, \Pr(M) = 0.1$. Find:
    -   $\Pr(X = 2)$\
    -   $\Pr(X \le 3\})$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.7: Mapping to Indicator Variables

Let a coin be tossed once and observe the heads up. Sample space:\
$$
S = \{h, t\}
$$

Define random variable\
$$
X(\omega) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \text{if } \omega = h \\
0 & \text{if } \omega = t
\end{cases}
$$

1.  Is $X$ a random variable? Why?
2.  Express the event - Tail occurs- using $X$.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.8: Mapping to Vectors

Two six-sided dice are rolled simultaneously.

The outcome is recorded as an ordered pair $(i, j)$, where:

-   $i$ is the number shown on the first die,

-   $j$ is the number shown on the second die.

The sample space is: 
$$
S = \{(i, j) : i, j \in \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}\}
$$



There are $6 \times 6 = 36$ possible outcomes in total.

Define the vector-valued r.v. $X(\omega) = (i, j)$ and scalar r.v.
$Y(\omega) = i + j$.

1.  What is the range of $X$?

2.  What is the range of $Y$?

3.  Express event $A = \{ \text{sum is even} \}$ using $Y$.



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.9: Categorical Mapping

Let a random person be chosen, and their blood type is recorded:\
$$
S = \{\text{A}, \text{B}, \text{AB}, \text{O}\}
$$

Define 
$$
X(\omega) =
\begin{cases}
1 & \omega = A \\
2 & \omega = B \\
3 & \omega = AB \\
4 & \omega = O
\end{cases}
$$

1.  Is $X$ a valid random variable?\
2.  Express the event “person has type A or O” using $X$.\
3.  Does numeric encoding affect the nature of $X$ as a r.v.?



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.10: Time to Event Mapping

Let $S = \{\text{system failure at } t : t \ge 0\}$\
Define $T(\omega) = \text{time of system failure}$

1.  What is the range of $T$?\
2.  Give an example of an event in terms of $T$.\
3.  Is $T$ discrete or continuous?



------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Activity 2.11: Mapping to Boolean (0/1) for Events

Suppose 5 MCQ questions are attempted. Each has a binary outcome
(Correct or Wrong).

Let $X_i = 1$ if $i^{th}$ question is correct, 0 otherwise.

Define total score:\
$$
S = \{ \text{outcomes of 5 questions} \}, \quad T = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5
$$

1.  What kind of random variable is $T$?\
2.  What is its range?\
3.  Define event $A = \{ \text{at least 3 correct} \}$ using $T$.



## Activity 2.12: Modeling Number of Attempts Until Success

A game involves rolling a fair six-sided die repeatedly until the number
**5** appears for the first time. Each roll is independent of the
others. The outcome is the **number of rolls** needed until the first 5
appears.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.  Define the sample space $S$ of the experiment using lowercase
    outcome sequences (e.g., rrr5, rr5, etc., where r = not 5, 5 =
    success).

2.  Define a random variable $X$ that maps each outcome $\omega$ to the
    number of rolls until the first 5 appears.

3.  Write the set $X(S)$, i.e., the range of the random variable.

4.  Compute the probability that the first 5 appears:

    -   on the 1st roll\
    -   on the 2nd roll\
    -   on the 3rd roll

5.  Let $p = \Pr(\text{a 5 is rolled})$. Write a general expression for
    $\Pr(X = x)$ where $x \in \{1, 2, 3, \dots\}$.

------------------------------------------------------------------------



## Activity 2.14: Waiting for a Fixed Number of Successes

A fair coin is tossed repeatedly until **3 Heads** are observed. Each
toss is independent of the others. The outcome is the **number of
tosses** required to get 3 Heads.

1.  Define the sample space $S$ using outcome sequences of h's and t's.
2.  Define the random variable $X$ as the number of tosses until the 3rd
    Head appears.
3.  Write the range $X(S)$.
4.  Write a general expression for $\Pr(X = x)$, where
    $x \in \{3, 4, 5, \dots\}$.
5.  Compute $\Pr(X = 3)$, $\Pr(X = 4)$, and $\Pr(X = 5)$ for a fair
    coin.
