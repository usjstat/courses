# 1.2 Event Operations

In probability theory, we often combine or relate different events using set operations. These operations help us define more complex events and calculate their probabilities.

### Complement
If \( A \) is an event in sample space \( S \), the **complement** of \( A \), denoted \( A' \), \( A^c \), or \( \bar{A} \), is the set of outcomes that are in \( S \) but **not** in \( A \).

> Example: If \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \) and \( A = \{2, 4, 6\} \), then \( A' = \{1, 3, 5\} \).

### Intersection
For two events \( A \) and \( B \), the **intersection** \( A \cap B \) is the set of outcomes that are in **both** \( A \) and \( B \).

> Think of this as the overlap between two events.

### Union
For two events \( A \) and \( B \), the **union** \( A \cup B \) is the set of outcomes that are in **either** \( A \) or \( B \) or **both**.

### Mutually Exclusive Events
Two events \( A \) and \( B \) are **mutually exclusive** (or disjoint) if they cannot occur at the same time. That is, \( A \cap B = \emptyset \).

### Exhaustive Events
A collection of events \( A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k \) is called **exhaustive** if their union covers the entire sample space: \( A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots \cup A_k = S \).

### Activity 1.9
Consider Activity 1.1. Write the following events as sets and express them in words.

1. \( B' \)  
2. \( C \cap D \)  
3. \( B \cup D \)  
4. \( B \cap D \)

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Let \( S = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \),  
\( B = \{1, 2\} \), \( C = \{2, 4, 6\} \), \( D = \{6\} \).

1. \( B' = \{3, 4, 5, 6\} \) — outcomes not less than 3.  
2. \( C \cap D = \{6\} \) — number that is both even and larger than 5.  
3. \( B \cup D = \{1, 2, 6\} \) — outcomes less than 3 or larger than 5.  
4. \( B \cap D = \emptyset \) — no number is both less than 3 and greater than 5.

### Activity 1.10
Consider Activity 1.5. Write the following events as sets and express them in words.

1. \( B' \)  
2. \( A \cup B \)  
3. \( B \cap C \)  
4. \( B \cup C \)

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Let \( S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\} \),  
\( A = \{5\} \), \( B = \{1, 2, 3, 4\} \), \( C = \{11, 12, 13, \ldots\} \)

1. \( B' = \{5, 6, 7, 8, \ldots\} \) — tosses 5 and above.  
2. \( A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5\} \) — tosses 5 or less.  
3. \( B \cap C = \emptyset \) — tosses can’t be both less than 5 and more than 10.  
4. \( B \cup C = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 11, 12, 13, \ldots\} \)

### Activity 1.11
Three products are selected at random, one after the other, from a production line. Let

- \( D_1 \) = The event that the first product is defective  
- \( D_2 \) = The event that the second product is defective  
- \( D_3 \) = The event that the third product is defective  
- \( E \) = The event that two of the three products are defective

Express \( E \) in terms of \( D_1, D_2, D_3 \) using event operations.

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

\( E = (D_1 \cap D_2 \cap D_3') \cup (D_1 \cap D_2' \cap D_3) \cup (D_1' \cap D_2 \cap D_3) \)

</details>

## Activity 1.12

Three components are connected to form a system in such a way that components 1 and 2 are connected in **parallel**, and this parallel arrangement is connected in **series** with component 3.

This means the system works if **at least one of** components 1 or 2 works, **and** component 3 also works.


Let:

- \( W_1 \) = The event that component 1 is in working condition  
- \( W_2 \) = The event that component 2 is in working condition  
- \( W_3 \) = The event that component 3 is in working condition  
- \( W \) = The event that the system is in working condition

Express \( W \) in terms of \( W_1, W_2, W_3 \) using event operations.

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Assuming components 1 and 2 are in parallel and component 3 is in series:  
\( W = (W_1 \cup W_2) \cap W_3 \)
