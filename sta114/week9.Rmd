## 2.1 Discrete Random Variables and Probability Mass Function (pmf)

**Definition 2.2**

A random variable with a **countable range** is called a **discrete random variable**.

---

**Definition 2.3**

The **probability mass function (pmf)** of a discrete random variable \( X \) is the function \( P_X \) defined as:

\[
P_X(x) = \Pr(X = x), \quad x \in \mathbb{R}
\]

---

### The Probability Mass Function

The **probability mass function (pmf)** of a discrete random variable \( X \) specifies the probability associated with each individual value in the range of \( X \).

---

### Example 2.3

Consider **Example 2.1**. Let \( X \) be the number of heads observed in 3 tosses of a (possibly biased) coin, where \( \theta = \Pr(\text{Head}) \).

Then, the pmf of \( X \) is given by:

\[
P_X(0) = (1 - \theta)^3
\]
\[
P_X(1) = 3\theta(1 - \theta)^2
\]
\[
P_X(2) = 3\theta^2(1 - \theta)
\]
\[
P_X(3) = \theta^3
\]
\[
P_X(x) = 0, \quad \text{if } x \notin \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]

---

We can write this compactly using a piecewise definition:

\[
P_X(x) =
\begin{cases}
(1 - \theta)^3 & \text{if } x = 0 \\
3\theta(1 - \theta)^2 & \text{if } x = 1 \\
3\theta^2(1 - \theta) & \text{if } x = 2 \\
\theta^3 & \text{if } x = 3 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Or, using the binomial form:

\[
P_X(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\binom{3}{x} \theta^x (1 - \theta)^{3 - x} & \text{for } x = 0, 1, 2, 3 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Or, simply:

\[
P_X(x) = \binom{3}{x} \theta^x (1 - \theta)^{3 - x}, \quad x = 0, 1, 2, 3
\]

---





## Activity 2.15

A (possibly biased) coin is tossed **repeatedly and independently** until the first Head (H) appears.  
Let the probability of Head on any single toss be \( \theta \in (0,1) \).

Define a random variable:

\[
X = \text{the number of tosses until the first Head appears}
\]



1. Write down the sample space \( S \) of this experiment using lowercase sample points.

2. Express the following events in terms of \( X \):
   - \( A = \{\text{first head appears on the 3rd toss} \} \)
   - \( B = \{\text{at most two tosses are needed} \} \)
   - \( C = \{\text{more than four tosses are needed} \} \)

3. Derive the probability mass function (pmf) of \( X \) and identify the distribution it follows.

4. For \( \theta = 0.3 \), compute:
   - \( \Pr(X = 3) \)
   - \( \Pr(X \geq 3) \)
   - \( \Pr(X > 4) \)


<details>

<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

 1. Sample Space \( S \)

Let \( X \) be the number of tosses until the first Head (H) appears.

The sample space consists of all finite sequences ending in the first Head, where all previous outcomes are Tails (T).

\[
S = \{ h,\ th,\ tth,\ ttth,\ tttth,\ \dots \}
\]

Each outcome corresponds to a success (H) occurring for the first time on the \( k \)th toss.


 2. Events in Terms of \( X \)

Let the random variable \( X \) denote the number of tosses until the first Head:

The event that the first Head appears on the 3rd toss or later can be written as:

\\[
\\{ \\omega \\in S : X(\\omega) \\geq 3 \\}
\\]

In sequence terms:

\\[
\\left\\{ \\omega \\in \\{t, h\\}^k : \\omega = t^{k-1}h,\\ k \\geq 3 \\right\\}
\\]

This describes all sequences of \\( k \\) tosses ending in a Head, preceded by \\( k-1 \\) Tails, where \\( k \\geq 3 \\).



 3. Probability Mass Function of \( X \)

Each toss is independent, and the first Head appears on the \( x \)th toss if the first \( x - 1 \) tosses are all Tails, followed by a Head.

\[
\Pr(X = x) = (1 - \theta)^{x - 1} \theta, \quad x = 1, 2, 3, \dots
\]

This is the **Geometric distribution** with parameter \( \theta \in (0,1) \).

 Piecewise form:

\[
P_X(x) =
\begin{cases}
(1 - \theta)^{x - 1} \theta & \text{for } x = 1, 2, 3, \dots \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]



 4. Numerical Computations (when \( \theta = 0.3 \))

Let's define:

```{r}
theta <- 0.3

# Pr(X = 3)
px3 <- (1 - theta)^(3 - 1) * theta
px3
```

```{r}
# Pr(X >= 3)
px_leq3 <- sum((1 - theta)^(1:3) * theta)
px_geq3 <- 1- px_leq3
px_geq3
```

```{r}
# Pr(X > 4) = 1 - Pr(X <= 4)
px_leq4 <- sum((1 - theta)^(1:4) * theta)
px_gt4 <- 1 - px_leq4
px_gt4
```

## Activity 2.16

A curd vendor, based on a large number of sales, has observed the following purchasing
behaviour:

<div style="text-align:center">

| Containers bought | Proportion of customers |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| 1                 | 70 % |
| 2                 | 15 % |
| 3                 | 10 % |
| 4                 | 5 % |

</div>




1. Let \(X\) be the **number of containers** bought by a randomly chosen customer.  
   - Write down the probability-mass function (pmf) of \(X\).

2. Let \(Y\) be the **number of customers observed until (and including) the first customer who buys 4 containers** on a given day.  
   - Derive the pmf \(P_Y(y)\) of \(Y\).

---


<details>

<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

1. Random Variable \( X \): Number of Containers Bought

Let \( X \) be the number of containers bought by a randomly chosen customer. Based on long-term observation, the probability mass function (pmf) of \( X \) is:

\[
P_X(x) =
\begin{cases}
0.70 & \text{if } x = 1 \\
0.15 & \text{if } x = 2 \\
0.10 & \text{if } x = 3 \\
0.05 & \text{if } x = 4 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

This can also be stored in R as:

```{r}
px <- c(
  '1 container' = 0.70,
  '2 containers' = 0.15,
  '3 containers' = 0.10,
  '4 containers' = 0.05
)
px
```



2. Random Variable \( Y \): Customers Until First Buying 4 Containers

Let \( Y \) be the number of customers observed until (and including) the first customer who buys **4 containers**.

This is modeled using the **Geometric distribution** with success probability \( p = 0.05 \).

The probability mass function (pmf) is:

\[
P_Y(y) = (1 - p)^{y - 1} p, \quad y = 1, 2, 3, \dots
\]

In R, this can be computed as:

```{r}
p <- 0.05

P_Y <- function(y, p = 0.05) {
  ifelse(y >= 1, (1 - p)^(y - 1) * p, 0)
}

y_vals <- 1:10
py_vals <- P_Y(y_vals)

data.frame(y = y_vals, P_Y = py_vals)
```



</details>

## Activity 2.17

Determine the value of \( c \) so that each of the following functions can serve as a **probability distribution** of the discrete random variable \( X \):

 (a)

\[
f(x) = c(x^2 + 4), \quad x = 0, 1, 2, 3
\]

 (b)

\[
f(x) = c \binom{2}{x} \binom{3}{3 - x}, \quad x = 0, 1, 2
\]


<details>

<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

(a)

To ensure that \( f(x) \) is a valid pmf, the total probability must sum to 1:

\[
\sum_{x=0}^{3} c(x^2 + 4) = 1
\]

Compute the sum:

\[
\begin{aligned}
&= c[(0^2 + 4) + (1^2 + 4) + (2^2 + 4) + (3^2 + 4)] \\
&= c[4 + 5 + 8 + 13] = c[30]
\end{aligned}
\]

Set equal to 1:

\[
c = \frac{1}{30}
\]

(b)

The function involves binomial coefficients:

\[
f(x) = c \binom{2}{x} \binom{3}{3 - x}, \quad x = 0, 1, 2
\]

Sum over possible values:

\[
\sum_{x=0}^{2} c \binom{2}{x} \binom{3}{3 - x} = 1
\]

Compute:

\[
\begin{aligned}
f(0) &= c \cdot \binom{2}{0} \binom{3}{3} = c(1)(1) = c \\
f(1) &= c \cdot \binom{2}{1} \binom{3}{2} = c(2)(3) = 6c \\
f(2) &= c \cdot \binom{2}{2} \binom{3}{1} = c(1)(3) = 3c \\
\end{aligned}
\]

\[
\text{Total} = c + 6c + 3c = 10c = 1 \Rightarrow c = \frac{1}{10}
\]

## Properties of a Probability Mass Function (pmf)

Let \( X \) be a discrete random variable with probability mass function \( P_X(x) = \Pr(X = x) \).

Then the following properties hold:

---

### 1. Non-negativity and boundedness

\[
\boxed{0 \leq P_X(x) \leq 1, \quad \text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}}
\]

**Explanation:**  
A pmf assigns probabilities to values taken by a discrete random variable. Since probabilities cannot be negative or greater than 1, this inequality must always be satisfied.  
This follows from the **axioms of probability**:
- Probabilities are never negative.
- No single event can have a probability greater than 1.

**Example:**  
In a fair die roll,
\[
P_X(x) = \frac{1}{6}, \quad x = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
\]
Here, each value satisfies \( 0 \leq \frac{1}{6} \leq 1 \).

---

### 2. Computing Probabilities of Events

Let \(E \subseteq \Omega\) be an event in the underlying sample space.  
Map this event into the **value space** of the random variable \(X\) by defining  

\[
\varepsilon \;=\; X(E) \;=\; \{\,x \in \mathbb{R} \mid X(\omega)=x \text{ for some } \omega \in E\,\}.
\]

Because the pmf \(P_X(x)=\Pr(X=x)\) is defined only on numerical values, the probability of the original event \(E\) is obtained by summing these point-masses over all values in \(\varepsilon\):

\[
\boxed{\;
\Pr(E) \;=\; \sum_{x \in \varepsilon} P_X(x)
\;}
\]

#### Explanation  
1. **Outcome layer**: \(E\) is a subset of outcomes in \(\Omega\).  
2. **Value layer**: \(\varepsilon\) is the set of numbers those outcomes produce through \(X\).  
3. Summing \(P_X(x)\) over \(\varepsilon\) aggregates the total probability assigned to every outcome in \(E\).

#### Example  
Let \(X\) be the number of heads in three coin tosses.  
Take the event

\[
E = \{X \ge 2\}.
\]

Its image in value space is  

\[
\varepsilon = \{2,3\}.
\]

Hence

\[
\Pr(E) = P_X(2) + P_X(3).
\]

---


### 3. Total Probability Over the Range of a Discrete Random Variable

Let \( S = \Omega \) be the sample space of the original experiment.  
Define  

\[
\mathcal{S} = X(S) = \left\{\,x \in \mathbb{R} \;\middle|\; X(\omega) = x \text{ for some } \omega \in S \right\}
\]

That is, \( \mathcal{S} \) denotes the **range** (or image) of the random variable \( X \), i.e., the set of all values \( X \) can take.

Then, the total probability assigned by the pmf over the entire range of \( X \) is:

\[
\boxed{\;\sum_{x \in \mathcal{S}} P_X(x) = 1\;}
\]

---

#### Explanation  
Since some outcome from the sample space \( S \) must occur, and \( X \) maps each outcome to an element in \( \mathcal{S} \), the **sum of all probability masses across \( \mathcal{S} \)** must equal 1.

This property guarantees that the probability measure induced by \( X \) is valid - it distributes total mass 1 over the values in its support.

---

#### Example  
Let \( X \) take values \( \{0, 1, 2, 3\} \), with

\[
P_X(0) = 0.1, \quad P_X(1) = 0.2, \quad P_X(2) = 0.4, \quad P_X(3) = 0.3
\]

Then the range of \( X \) is  
\[
\mathcal{S} = \{0, 1, 2, 3\}
\]

and the total probability is

\[
\sum_{x \in \mathcal{S}} P_X(x) = 0.1 + 0.2 + 0.4 + 0.3 = 1.
\]

Thus, the pmf satisfies the total probability condition.

---

## 2.2 Continuous Random Variables and Probability Density Function (pdf)

**Definition 2.4**

A random variable with an **uncountable range**, typically intervals of real numbers, is called a **continuous random variable**.

---

**Definition 2.5**

The **probability density function (pdf)** of a continuous random variable \( X \) is a function \( f_X \) satisfying:

- \( f_X(x) \geq 0 \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \)
- \( \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x)\,dx = 1 \)

The probability that \( X \) lies in an interval \( [a, b] \) is given by:

\[
\Pr(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f_X(x)\, dx
\]

---

### Properties of a Probability Density Function

#### 1. Non-negativity

\[
\boxed{f_X(x) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } x \in \mathbb{R}}
\]

This ensures the density never assigns negative values, aligning with the axioms of probability.

---

#### 2. Total Area Under the Curve is 1

\[
\boxed{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f_X(x)\, dx = 1}
\]

This is the continuous analog of the total probability rule for pmfs.

---

#### 3. Probabilities are Assigned to Intervals

For any interval \( [a, b] \):

\[
\Pr(a \leq X \leq b) = \int_a^b f_X(x)\, dx
\]

Unlike discrete random variables, the probability of taking any exact value is zero:

\[
\Pr(X = x) = 0
\]

---

### Example 2.6

Let \( X \) be a continuous random variable with density function:

\[
f_X(x) =
\begin{cases}
2x & \text{for } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

#### (a) Verify that \( f_X \) is a valid pdf

\[
\int_0^1 2x\,dx = \left[x^2\right]_0^1 = 1
\Rightarrow \text{Valid pdf}
\]

#### (b) Compute \( \Pr(0.2 \leq X \leq 0.6) \)

\[
\Pr(0.2 \leq X \leq 0.6) = \int_{0.2}^{0.6} 2x\,dx = \left[x^2\right]_{0.2}^{0.6} = 0.36 - 0.04 = 0.32
\]

---

## Activity 2.18

Let \( X \) be a continuous random variable with density:

\[
f(x) =
\begin{cases}
3x^2 & \text{for } 0 \leq x \leq 1 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]

Answer the following:

1. Show that \( f \) is a valid probability density function.
2. Compute \( \Pr(X \leq 0.5) \)
3. Compute \( \Pr(0.25 \leq X \leq 0.75) \)

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

1. Check validity:

\[
\int_0^1 3x^2\,dx = \left[x^3\right]_0^1 = 1
\Rightarrow f \text{ is valid}
\]

2. Compute:

\[
\Pr(X \leq 0.5) = \int_0^{0.5} 3x^2\,dx = \left[x^3\right]_0^{0.5} = 0.125
\]

3. Compute:

\[
\Pr(0.25 \leq X \leq 0.75) = \int_{0.25}^{0.75} 3x^2\,dx = x^3 \Big|_{0.25}^{0.75} = 0.422 - 0.016 = 0.406
\]

</details>

---

## Interpretation of the Density Function

- A **density function is not a probability**, but an indication of how *dense* the probability is at different values.
- The height of the pdf curve does **not** exceed 1 necessarily, but the **area under the curve** must be 1.
- Probability is always computed as **area under the curve** over an interval.
