# 1.5 Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is a way of measuring the probability of an event **given that another event has already occurred**.

We denote the conditional probability of event $A$ given event $B$ as:

$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} \quad \text{(provided } \Pr(B) \ne 0 \text{)}
$$

This is the **fundamental definition** of conditional probability.

## Why Conditional Probability?

In many real-world scenarios, we already know that something has happened (event $B$), and we are interested in the likelihood of another event (event $A$) under that condition.

## Activity 1.26

A box contains 3 white balls numbered 1, 2, 3 and 2 black balls numbered 1, 2. A ball is picked at random.

Let:

- $A$: the event that the ball has number 1  
- $B$: the event that the ball is white

1. Find $\Pr(A)$  
2. Find $\Pr(A \mid B)$


---

## Activity 1.27

A box contains 3 white balls and 2 black balls. Two balls are selected **without replacement**.

Let:

- $A$ = first ball is white  
- $B$ = second ball is black

1. Find $\Pr(B \mid A)$  
2. Find $\Pr(B \mid A')$


  



---

## Activity 1.28

Repeat the above scenario but assume the balls are selected **with replacement**.

1. Find $\Pr(B)$  
2. Find $\Pr(B \mid A)$  
3. Are the events $A$ and $B$ independent?

## Conditional Probability Tree Diagram

A **tree diagram** is a graphical tool that helps visualize multi-stage experiments and **conditional probabilities**.

Each **branch** represents a stage of the experiment, with associated probabilities. To compute the probability of a final outcome, multiply along the path.

## Activity 1.29

**Scenario:**  
A shop sells 3 TV brands:

- 50% are Brand A  
- 30% are Brand B  
- 20% are Brand C  

Warranty repair probabilities:

- Brand A: 25%  
- Brand B: 20%  
- Brand C: 10%

Let:

- $A, B, C$ = brand events  
- $R$ = requires repair

### Draw a tree diagram and answer:

1. What is $\Pr(R)$?  
2. What is $\Pr(A \mid R)$?

## Activity 1.30

Consider the bonus scheme data from Activity 1.25. Let:

- $C$: the employee is a **Clerk**  
- $S_2$: the employee has **bonus scheme II**  
- $E$: the employee is an **Executive**  
- $S_1$: the employee has **bonus scheme I**

1. Find $\Pr(S_2 \mid C)$  
2. Find $\Pr(E \mid S_1)$

## Definition: Independent Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if:

$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \Pr(A) \quad \text{or} \quad \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \Pr(B)
$$

---

## Activity 1.31

Using the data from Activity 1.27 (no replacement), determine if $A$ (first white) and $B$ (second black) are independent.


---

## Note: Mutually Exclusive Events vs. Independent Events

Students often confuse **mutually exclusive** events with **independent** events, but they are fundamentally different concepts.

### Mutually Exclusive Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be **mutually exclusive** (or disjoint) if:

$$
A \cap B = \emptyset \quad \text{or} \quad \Pr(A \cap B) = 0
$$

This means **both events cannot occur at the same time**.

**Example:**  
- Let $A$ = "roll a 2 on a die", $B$ = "roll a 5".  
- These are mutually exclusive because both outcomes cannot happen in a single roll.

If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, then:

$$
\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B)
$$

---

### Independent Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if the occurrence of one **does not affect** the probability of the other. Formally:

$$
\Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B)
$$

This is equivalent to:

$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \Pr(A) \quad \text{and} \quad \Pr(B \mid A) = \Pr(B)
$$

**Important distinction**:
- Mutually exclusive events **cannot happen together**, so their intersection is 0.  
- Independent events **can happen together**, but one does not influence the other.

**Note:** If two events are **mutually exclusive and both have nonzero probability**, then they **cannot be independent**.

---

## Independence for More Than Two Events

Let $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ be a collection of events.

These events are said to be **mutually independent** if **every possible subset** of these events satisfies:

$$
\Pr(A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}) = \Pr(A_{i_1}) \cdot \Pr(A_{i_2}) \cdot \cdots \cdot \Pr(A_{i_k})
$$

for all $1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k \leq n$, and for every $k = 2, 3, \dots, n$.

This is stronger than **pairwise independence**, which only requires:

$$
\Pr(A_i \cap A_j) = \Pr(A_i) \cdot \Pr(A_j) \quad \text{for all } i \ne j
$$

- Conditional probability helps update our beliefs when new information is known.
- It underlies many important rules like the **Multiplication Rule**, **Bayes' Theorem**, and the concept of **Independence**.
- Tree diagrams are valuable for organizing probabilities in multi-stage processes.
