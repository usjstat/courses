# 1.5 Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is a way of measuring the probability of an event **given that another event has already occurred**.

We denote the conditional probability of event $A$ given event $B$ as:

$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} \quad \text{(provided } \Pr(B) \ne 0 \text{)}
$$

This is the **fundamental definition** of conditional probability.

## Why Conditional Probability?

In many real-world scenarios, we already know that something has happened (event $B$), and we are interested in the likelihood of another event (event $A$) under that condition.

## Activity 1.26

A box contains 3 white balls numbered 1, 2, 3 and 2 black balls numbered 1, 2. A ball is picked at random.

Let:

- $A$: the event that the ball has number 1  
- $B$: the event that the ball is white

1. Find $\Pr(A)$  
2. Find $\Pr(A \mid B)$

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

There are 5 balls total:  
White: (1, 2, 3) and Black: (1, 2)

1. $\Pr(A)$ = Number of balls with number 1 / Total number of balls  
There are 2 balls with number 1 (white 1 and black 1):  
$$
\Pr(A) = \frac{2}{5}
$$

2. $\Pr(A \mid B)$ = Probability the number is 1 **given** the ball is white  
Among white balls: {1, 2, 3}  
Only one of them has number 1  
$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{1}{3}
$$

</details>

## Activity 1.27

A box contains 3 white balls and 2 black balls. Two balls are selected **without replacement**.

Let:

- $A$ = first ball is white  
- $B$ = second ball is black

1. Find $\Pr(B \mid A)$  
2. Find $\Pr(B \mid A')$

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Total number of balls = 3 white + 2 black = **5**



 1. Find $\Pr(B \mid A)$

If the **first ball is white**, one white is removed.

Remaining:  
- 2 white  
- 2 black  
- Total = 4

So,  
$$
\Pr(B \mid A) = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5
$$

2. Find $\Pr(B \mid A')$

If the **first ball is black**, one black is removed.

Remaining:  
- 3 white  
- 1 black  
- Total = 4

So,  
$$
\Pr(B \mid A') = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25
$$

---

## Activity 1.28

Repeat the above scenario but assume the balls are selected **with replacement**.

1. Find $\Pr(B)$  
2. Find $\Pr(B \mid A)$  
3. Are the events $A$ and $B$ independent?

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

With replacement, the total remains 5 for each draw.

- $\Pr(A) = \frac{3}{5}$  
- $\Pr(B) = \frac{2}{5}$  
- $\Pr(B \mid A) = \frac{2}{5}$

Since $\Pr(B \mid A) = \Pr(B)$, $A$ and $B$ are **independent**.

## Conditional Probability Tree Diagram

A **tree diagram** is a graphical tool that helps visualize multi-stage experiments and **conditional probabilities**.

Each **branch** represents a stage of the experiment, with associated probabilities. To compute the probability of a final outcome, multiply along the path.

## Activity 1.29

**Scenario:**  
A shop sells 3 TV brands:

- 50% are Brand A  
- 30% are Brand B  
- 20% are Brand C  

Warranty repair probabilities:

- Brand A: 25%  
- Brand B: 20%  
- Brand C: 10%

Let:

- $A, B, C$ = brand events  
- $R$ = requires repair

### Draw a tree diagram and answer:

1. What is $\Pr(R)$?  
2. What is $\Pr(A \mid R)$?

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

**Tree structure:**

- First layer: Choose brand  
- Second layer: Repair or not

$$
\Pr(R) = \Pr(R \mid A) \Pr(A) + \Pr(R \mid B) \Pr(B) + \Pr(R \mid C) \Pr(C) \\
= 0.25 \cdot 0.5 + 0.2 \cdot 0.3 + 0.1 \cdot 0.2 = 0.125 + 0.06 + 0.02 = 0.205
$$

## Activity 1.30

Consider the bonus scheme data from Activity 1.25. Let:

- $C$: the employee is a **Clerk**  
- $S_2$: the employee has **bonus scheme II**  
- $E$: the employee is an **Executive**  
- $S_1$: the employee has **bonus scheme I**

1. Find $\Pr(S_2 \mid C)$  
2. Find $\Pr(E \mid S_1)$

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

From the table:

- Total clerks = 170  
- Clerks with scheme II = 44  
$$
\Pr(S_2 \mid C) = \frac{44}{170} \approx 0.2588
$$

- Total with Type I = 300  
- Executives with Type I = 5  
$$
\Pr(E \mid S_1) = \frac{5}{300} \approx 0.0167
$$

## Definition: Independent Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if:

$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \Pr(A) \quad \text{or} \quad \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \Pr(B)
$$

---

## Activity 1.31

Using the data from Activity 1.27 (no replacement), determine if $A$ (first white) and $B$ (second black) are independent.

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Recall:

- $\Pr(B \mid A) = 0.5$  
- $\Pr(B) = 0.4$

Since $\Pr(B \mid A) \ne \Pr(B)$, $A$ and $B$ are **not independent**.

</details>

## Note: Mutually Exclusive Events vs. Independent Events

Students often confuse **mutually exclusive** events with **independent** events, but they are fundamentally different concepts.

### Mutually Exclusive Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are said to be **mutually exclusive** (or disjoint) if:

$$
A \cap B = \emptyset \quad \text{or} \quad \Pr(A \cap B) = 0
$$

This means **both events cannot occur at the same time**.

**Example:**  
- Let $A$ = "roll a 2 on a die", $B$ = "roll a 5".  
- These are mutually exclusive because both outcomes cannot happen in a single roll.

If $A$ and $B$ are mutually exclusive, then:

$$
\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B)
$$

---

### Independent Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if the occurrence of one **does not affect** the probability of the other. Formally:

$$
\Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B)
$$

This is equivalent to:

$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \Pr(A) \quad \text{and} \quad \Pr(B \mid A) = \Pr(B)
$$

**Important distinction**:
- Mutually exclusive events **cannot happen together**, so their intersection is 0.  
- Independent events **can happen together**, but one does not influence the other.

**Note:** If two events are **mutually exclusive and both have nonzero probability**, then they **cannot be independent**.

---

## Independence for More Than Two Events

Let $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$ be a collection of events.

These events are said to be **mutually independent** if **every possible subset** of these events satisfies:

$$
\Pr(A_{i_1} \cap A_{i_2} \cap \cdots \cap A_{i_k}) = \Pr(A_{i_1}) \cdot \Pr(A_{i_2}) \cdot \cdots \cdot \Pr(A_{i_k})
$$

for all $1 \leq i_1 < i_2 < \cdots < i_k \leq n$, and for every $k = 2, 3, \dots, n$.

This is stronger than **pairwise independence**, which only requires:

$$
\Pr(A_i \cap A_j) = \Pr(A_i) \cdot \Pr(A_j) \quad \text{for all } i \ne j
$$

- Conditional probability helps update our beliefs when new information is known.
- It underlies many important rules like the **Multiplication Rule**, **Bayes' Theorem**, and the concept of **Independence**.
- Tree diagrams are valuable for organizing probabilities in multi-stage processes.
