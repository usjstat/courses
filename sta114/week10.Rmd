### Definition: Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf)

For any random variable \(X\), the **cdf** is
\[
F_X(t) = \Pr(X \le t).
\]

This single function determines probabilities of all events that can be expressed in terms of \(X\).

---

### From Events to the CDF

For real numbers \(a \le b\),
\[
\Pr(a < X \le b) = F_X(b) - F_X(a).
\]

(Other combinations of strict/weak inequalities give the same value for continuous \(X\); for discrete \(X\) they may differ by point masses.)

A useful identity for discrete points is
\[
\Pr(X = x) = F_X(x) - F_X(x-0),
\]
where \(F_X(x-0)\) is the left limit of \(F_X\) at \(x\).

---

### Properties of Every CDF

1. **Non-decreasing:** if \(t_1 < t_2\), then \(F_X(t_1) \le F_X(t_2)\).\

2. **Limits:** \(\displaystyle \lim_{t\to -\infty}F_X(t)=0,\quad \lim_{t\to \infty}F_X(t)=1.\)\

3. **Right-continuous:** \(\displaystyle \lim_{h\downarrow 0} F_X(t+h)=F_X(t).\)\
 -- right-continuous allows jumps but forbids “holes” when you approach from the right.

## Example: Dartboard CDF (Distance from the Bullseye)

A dart is thrown at a **circular dartboard** of radius \(R\). **Assume the dart always hits the board and,  conditional on a hit, the landing point is uniformly distributed over the face of the board** (i.e., any two regions of equal area are equally likely to be hit).

Let \(X\) be the **distance from the dart's landing point to the bullseye (center)**.

**Task:** Derive the cumulative distribution function (cdf) of \(X\), namely
\[
F_X(t) = \Pr(X \le t),
\]
for all real \(t\).

### Solution

Because the hit is **uniform over area**, probability is proportional to area.

1. **Event geometry**  
   - For \(0\le t\le R\), the event \(\{X\le t\}\) is a disk of radius \(t\).  
   - Area of that disk: \(\pi t^{2}\).  
   - Area of the whole board: \(\pi R^{2}\).

   Hence  
   \[
   \Pr(X\le t)=\frac{\pi t^{2}}{\pi R^{2}}=\left(\frac{t}{R}\right)^{2},\qquad 0\le t\le R.
   \]

2. **Outside the feasible range**
   - If \(t<0\): distances cannot be negative \(\;\Rightarrow\; F_X(t)=0\).  
   - If \(t>R\): the dart always lands within distance \(R\) \(\;\Rightarrow\; F_X(t)=1\).

---

#### Piecewise form

\[
\boxed{
F_X(t)=
\begin{cases}
0, & t<0,\\[6pt]
\left(\dfrac{t}{R}\right)^{2}, & 0\le t\le R,\\[10pt]
1, & t>R.
\end{cases}}
\]

### Example – Number of Heads in Three Tosses

Experiment: toss a fair coin three times, and record the face up at each trial.  
Random variable: \(X=\) total number of heads.



- There are \(2^3 = 8\) equally‐likely outcome sequences.  
- Exactly one sequence has 0 heads (ttt) → \(1/8\).  
- Exactly one sequence has 3 heads (hhh) → \(1/8\).  
- \(\binom{3}{1}=3\) sequences have 1 head → \(3/8\).  
- \(\binom{3}{2}=3\) sequences have 2 heads → \(3/8\).

---

#### Building the cdf \(F_X(t)=\Pr(X\le t)\)

1. **\(t<0\)**  
   No outcome gives \(X<0\) ⇒ \(F_X(t)=0\).

2. **\(0\le t<1\)**  
   Only \(X=0\) satisfies \(X\le t\).  
   \[
   F_X(t)=\Pr(X=0)=\frac18.
   \]

3. **\(1\le t<2\)**  
   \(X\) can be 0 or 1.  
   \[
   F_X(t)=\Pr(X=0)+\Pr(X=1)=\frac18+\frac38=\frac12.
   \]

4. **\(2\le t<3\)**  
   \(X\) can be 0,1,2.  
   \[
   F_X(t)=\frac18+\frac38+\frac38=\frac78.
   \]

5. **\(t\ge 3\)**  
   All possibilities counted ⇒ \(F_X(t)=1\).

---

#### Resulting piecewise form

\[
\boxed{
F_X(t)=
\begin{cases}
0, & t<0,\\[4pt]
\dfrac18, & 0\le t<1,\\[10pt]
\dfrac12, & 1\le t<2,\\[10pt]
\dfrac78, & 2\le t<3,\\[10pt]
1, & t\ge 3.
\end{cases}}
\]

Each step height equals the probability at that \(x\); cumulative sums give the cdf.


## Example – Stepwise CDF from a Finite Support

Suppose a discrete random variable \( X \) takes values in a **finite set**:

\[
X \in \{-3,\ 1,\ 2,\ 5\}
\]

with corresponding probabilities:

\[
\boxed{
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}
x & -3 & 1 & 2 & 5 \\
\hline
\Pr(X = x) & \dfrac{1}{2} & \dfrac{1}{3} & \dfrac{1}{6} & 0 \\
\end{array}
}
\]


We define the **cumulative distribution function (cdf)** of \( X \) as:

\[
F_X(t) = \Pr(X \le t)
\]

---

### Stepwise Structure of the CDF

Because \(X\) is a **discrete** random variable, its CDF is a **step function**:

- The function is **constant between jumps**.
- It **jumps only at values in the support of \(X\)**.
- Each jump has a height equal to the **probability mass at that point**.

---

### Piecewise Definition of the CDF

\[
F_X(t) =
\begin{cases}
0, & t < -3 \\
\frac{1}{2}, & -3 \le t < 1 \\
\frac{5}{6}, & 1 \le t < 2 \\
1, & 2 \le t < 5 \\
1, & t \ge 5
\end{cases}
\]

> Note: The value \(x = 5\) has probability 0, so the CDF does **not jump** at that point — it remains constant at 1.

---

### Explanation

- For \( t < -3 \), no value of \(X\) is less than or equal to \(t\) → \(F_X(t) = 0\).
- For \( -3 \le t < 1 \), only \(X = -3\) contributes → \(F_X(t) = \Pr(X = -3) = \frac{1}{2}\).
- For \( 1 \le t < 2 \), \(X = -3\) and \(X = 1\) are counted → \(F_X(t) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{5}{6}\).
- For \( 2 \le t < 5 \), we include \(X = 2\) as well → \(F_X(t) = \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{6} = 1\).
- For \( t \ge 5 \), we still have \(F_X(t) = 1\) because all mass has been accumulated.

---

### Visual Insight

The CDF rises in **jumps** of:\

 \(+\frac{1}{2}\) at \(x = -3\),\
 \(+\frac{1}{3}\) at \(x = 1\),\
 \(+\frac{1}{6}\) at \(x = 2\).\

There is **no jump at \(x = 5\)** because \(\Pr(X = 5) = 0\).

```{r fig.width=6, fig.height=4}
library(ggplot2)

# Define values and cumulative probabilities
x_vals <- c(-3, 1, 2, 5)
probs <- c(1/2, 1/3, 1/6, 0)
cdf_vals <- cumsum(probs)

# Extended t values for plotting step function
t_vals <- c(-4, -3, 1, 2, 5, 6)
F_vals <- c(0, 1/2, 5/6, 1, 1, 1)

# Plot
ggplot(data.frame(t = t_vals, F = F_vals), aes(x = t, y = F)) +
  geom_step(direction = "hv") +
  geom_point(data = data.frame(x = x_vals, y = cdf_vals),
             aes(x = x, y = y), color = "red", size = 2) +

       x = "t", y = expression(F[X](t))) +
  theme_minimal()
```

---

### Example – Waiting for the First Ace

Experiment: toss a die repeatedly; \(X=\) number of tosses until the first “ace” (1).  
For \(k=1,2,\dots\):
\[
\Pr(X=k)=\left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{k-1}\!\left(\frac{1}{6}\right).
\]
The cdf is
\[
\boxed{
F_X(t)=
\begin{cases}
0, & t<1,\\
\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor t \rfloor} \left(\frac{5}{6}\right)^{k-1}\!\left(\frac{1}{6}\right), & t\ge 1.
\end{cases}}
\]

---

## Quantiles

### Definition 2.3 (Quantile)

For \(0<p<1\), a **\(p\)-quantile** \(t_p\) is any solution of the inequalities
\[
\Pr(X \le t) \ge p, \qquad \Pr(X \ge t) \ge 1-p.
\]
Equivalently,
\[
F_X(t) \ge p,\qquad F_X(t-0) \le p.
\]

Special names:  
- \(t_{0.5}\): **median**  
- \(t_{0.25},\, t_{0.75}\): **lower and upper quartiles**

---

### Example – Quantiles for the Target Distance

Using \(F_X(t) = (t/R)^2\) on \([0,R]\), solve \((t_p/R)^2=p\).  \

Thus \(t_p = R\sqrt{p}\);\

e.g. \(t_{0.25}=R/2\).

---

### Example – Quantiles in a Discrete Distribution

Let the random variable \(X\) take the values:

\[
X \in \{1, 2, 3\} \quad \text{with} \quad 
\Pr(X=1) = 0.2, \quad 
\Pr(X=2) = 0.6, \quad 
\Pr(X=3) = 0.2
\]

---

### Step 1: Construct the Cumulative Distribution Function (cdf)

\[
F_X(x) = 
\begin{cases}
0, & x < 1 \\
0.2, & 1 \le x < 2 \\
0.8, & 2 \le x < 3 \\
1, & x \ge 3
\end{cases}
\]

---

### Step 2: Define the \(p\)-Quantile

For any \(p \in (0,1)\), the **\(p\)-quantile** of a random variable \(X\) is:

\[
t_p = \inf\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid F_X(x) \ge p\}
\]
### Explanation

This definition uses the **infimum** (greatest lower bound) to find the smallest value \(x\) such that the cumulative distribution function (cdf) \(F_X(x)\) reaches or exceeds the probability level \(p\).

Let’s break it down:

- The **cdf** \(F_X(x)\) gives the probability that the random variable \(X\) takes a value less than or equal to \(x\), i.e., \(F_X(x) = \Pr(X \le x)\).
  
- The **set** \(\{x \in \mathbb{R} \mid F_X(x) \ge p\}\) contains all values of \(x\) for which the cumulative probability is at least \(p\).

- The **infimum** of this set is the smallest such \(x\) that satisfies the inequality \(F_X(x) \ge p\). This ensures that \(t_p\) is the **leftmost point** where the cdf crosses the level \(p\).

---

In the discrete case, this often involves checking intervals where the cdf jumps.

---

### Step 3: Compute Specific Quantiles

- **Median** (\(p = 0.5\)):

  We seek the smallest \(x\) such that \(F_X(x) \ge 0.5\).

  \[
  F_X(1) = 0.2 \quad \text{(too small)}\\
  F_X(2) = 0.8 \ge 0.5 \Rightarrow t_{0.5} = 2
  \]

- **First Quartile** (\(p = 0.25\)):

  \[
  F_X(1) = 0.2 \quad \text{(too small)}\\
  F_X(2) = 0.8 \ge 0.25 \Rightarrow t_{0.25} = 2
  \]

- **Third Quartile** (\(p = 0.75\)):

  \[
  F_X(2) = 0.8 \ge 0.75 \Rightarrow t_{0.75} = 2
  \]

- **90th Percentile** (\(p = 0.90\)):

  \[
  F_X(3) = 1.0 \ge 0.90 \Rightarrow t_{0.90} = 3
  \]

---

### Summary Table of Quantiles

\[
\begin{array}{c|c}
\text{Quantile Level } p & t_p \\
\hline
0.25 & 2 \\
0.50 & 2 \\
0.75 & 2 \\
0.90 & 3 \\
\end{array}
\]

Note: In a **discrete** distribution, many different \(p\)-quantiles may map to the same value of \(X\), depending on where the jumps in the cdf occur.


---

### Theorem – Probability Between Quantiles

If \(F\) is continuous and \(0<\alpha<\beta<1\), then for any \(\alpha\)- and \(\beta\)-quantiles \(t_\alpha, t_\beta\),
\[
\Pr(t_\alpha \le X \le t_\beta) = \beta - \alpha.
\]

**Example** With a continuous cdf, the probability that \(X\) lies between its first and third quartiles is \(0.75-0.25=0.5\).

---

### Practical Use: Probabilities via Quantiles

- To find \(t_p\), solve \(F_X(t_p)=p\) (when a solution exists).  
- To compute \(\Pr(X\in [t_\alpha, t_\beta])\) for a continuous cdf, use Theorem – Probability Between Quantiles.  
- In discrete cases, use the inequality definition to locate the smallest \(t\) with \(F_X(t)\ge p\).
