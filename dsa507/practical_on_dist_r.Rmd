# Practical Session: Distributions in Applied Data Science

In this session, you will explore key probability distributions by applying them to real or simulated data. The tasks are designed to be completed in either **R** or **Python**. Choose your preferred language and follow the instructions accordingly.

---

## Datasets

All datasets used are either built-in or can be generated using a fixed random seed for reproducibility:

- **Simulated Binomial Events** (e.g., success/failure outcomes)
- **HairEyeColor** (R) or Titanic dataset (Python) for Chi-Square testing
- **Simulated small samples** for t-distribution exploration
- **Simulated group scores** for F-distribution (ANOVA)
- **Arrival times / event rates** for Poisson, Exponential, Weibull models

## Instructions for R Users

### 1. Binomial Distribution

- Simulate 1000 observations of a binary outcome (success/failure) with success probability 0.3.
- Calculate the proportion of observations with exactly 3 successes in 5 trials.
- Use `dbinom()` and `pbinom()` to calculate point and cumulative probabilities.

### 2. Chi-Square Test

- Use the built-in `HairEyeColor` dataset.
- Perform a Chi-square test to examine whether eye color is independent of hair color.
- Plot a bar chart of the observed counts.

### 3. Student's t-Distribution

- Simulate two small samples of size 10 from different means.
- Conduct a two-sample t-test using `t.test()` and interpret the result.
- Visualize both distributions using `hist()` or `ggplot()`.

### 4. F-Distribution (ANOVA)

- Simulate three groups (n = 10 each) with increasing means.
- Perform an ANOVA using `aov()`.
- Interpret the F-statistic and p-value.

### 5. Poisson and Related Distributions

- Simulate 100 Poisson-distributed counts with lambda = 3.
- Simulate inter-arrival times from an exponential distribution with rate = 0.5.
- Simulate failure times from a Weibull distribution.
- Visualize all three distributions using histograms.

## Instructions for Python Users

### 1. Binomial Distribution

- Simulate 1000 binary outcomes using `numpy.random.binomial(n=5, p=0.3)`.
- Calculate the probability of exactly 3 successes using `scipy.stats.binom.pmf()`.
- Plot the binomial PMF using `matplotlib` or `seaborn`.

### 2. Chi-Square Test

- Use the Titanic dataset from `seaborn` (`sns.load_dataset("titanic")`).
- Perform a Chi-square test for independence between `sex` and `class` using `scipy.stats.chi2_contingency()`.
- Plot a stacked bar chart of observed counts.

### 3. Student's t-Distribution

- Generate two small samples (n=10) with different means using `numpy`.
- Use `scipy.stats.ttest_ind()` to perform a two-sample t-test.
- Plot both distributions using histograms.

### 4. F-Distribution (ANOVA)

- Simulate three groups of data with different means.
- Use `scipy.stats.f_oneway()` to perform one-way ANOVA.
- Interpret the F-statistic and p-value.

### 5. Poisson and Related Distributions

- Simulate 100 Poisson counts using `scipy.stats.poisson.rvs()`.
- Simulate exponential wait times using `scipy.stats.expon.rvs()`.
- Simulate failure times from a Weibull distribution using `scipy.stats.weibull_min.rvs()`.
- Plot histograms for all three.
