## Practical Objective

This session helps you to understand the computation and interpretation of the chi-square test, including both theoretical and resampling-based approaches, with applications to sports analytics.

### Task 1: Create the Contingency Table

**Scenario:**  
Three volleyball players attempted 50 serves each. The number of successful and failed serves is recorded:

| Player   | Success | Fail |
|----------|---------|------|
| Player A | 42      | 8    |
| Player B | 36      | 14   |
| Player C | 40      | 10   |


### Task 2: Compute Expected Counts and Chi-Square Statistic



### Task 3: Theoretical Chi-Square Test




### Task 4: Permutation Test (Resampling Approach)



### Task 5: Interpretation Questions

1. Which cells contribute most to the chi-square statistic?
2. Does the permutation p-value differ significantly from the theoretical p-value?
3. Are you confident rejecting the null hypothesis? Why or why not?

## Task 6: Optional Fisher's Exact Test for 2x2
