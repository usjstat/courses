## Course Introduction

The aim of this course is to introduce postgraduate students in Data Science and AI to the essential concepts and techniques of statistics. The course balances theoretical foundations with practical applications using R and Python, including data collection, descriptive and inferential analysis, and probabilistic modeling.

Upon successful completion, students will be able to: - Understand the role and limitations of statistics in data science - Classify variables and identify suitable scales of measurement - Apply effective data collection and sampling methods - Perform descriptive and inferential statistical analyses - Calculate and interpret probabilities for real-world scenarios
