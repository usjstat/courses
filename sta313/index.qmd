# Course Overview

**Course:** STA 313 1.0 : Statistical Decision Theory\

**Credits:** 1 (8 x 2-hour lectures)

**Semester/Year:** Semester II - 2025\

**Audience:** Third Year Statistics undergraduates (optional)

**Mode:** Lecture + worked examples + short activities\

**Suggested Assessment:** mini-project (40%), final exam (60%)

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Specify actions, states of nature, loss functions, and risk for a decision problem.

2.  Choose suitable loss functions and interpret risk functions for estimation/classification tasks.

3.  Derive Bayes rules under common losses and compute Bayes risk in simple models.

4.  Explain and apply minimax and admissibility; relate least favorable priors to minimaxity.

5.  Compare Bayesian and frequentist decision rules analytically and via simulation.

6.  Communicate decisions, uncertainty, and trade-offs for real applications.

# Mini-Project (Weeks 7-8)

Choose one application (medical, QC, sports, or business).\
1. Specify losses/costs and (if Bayesian) priors.\
2. Propose two competing decision rules.\
3. Compare risks analytically or via Monte Carlo; do sensitivity analysis.\
4. Deliver a short memo justifying the recommended rule for stakeholders.

*This course is designed for USJ and effective from 21st October 2025.*
