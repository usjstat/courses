## 📘 Introduction

This course offers a practical and computational approach to Bayesian inference, focusing on simulation-based techniques for solving complex models.

Students will learn:
- The foundations of Bayesian thinking
- Posterior analysis using simulation
- Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods
- Model comparison and convergence diagnostics

We will work primarily in **R**, using packages such as `rstan`, `rjags`, and `brms`. However, **Python** codes will also be provided for your convenience. 

All course materials will be published on this page.
