## Introduction

This course offers a practical and computational approach to Bayesian inference, focusing on simulation-based techniques for solving complex models.

Learning outcomes:

-   The foundations of Bayesian thinking\
-   Posterior analysis using simulation\
-   Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods\
-   Model comparison and convergence diagnostics\

We will work primarily in **R**, using packages such as `rstan`, `rjags`, and `brms`. However, **Python** codes will also be provided for your convenience.

All course materials will be published on this page.
