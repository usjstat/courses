# 1.2 Event Operations

In probability theory, we often combine or relate different events using set operations. These operations help us define more complex events and calculate their probabilities.

### Complement

If $A$ is an event in sample space $S$, the **complement** of $A$, denoted $A'$, $A^c$, or $\bar{A}$, is the set of outcomes that are in $S$ but **not** in $A$.

> **Example (CAL context):**  
> Let $S = \{\text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}, \text{BB}, \text{B}\}$ represent the credit ratings of bonds in a portfolio.  
> Let $A = \{\text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}\}$ be the set of **investment-grade bonds**.  
> Then the **complement** of $A$ is:  
> $A' = \{\text{BB}, \text{B}\}$ - these are the **non-investment-grade (speculative-grade)** bonds.


### Intersection

For two events $A$ and $B$, the **intersection** $A \cap B$ is the set of outcomes that are in **both** $A$ and $B$.

> **Example (CAL context):**  
> Let $S = \{\text{Equity}, \text{Fixed Income}, \text{Balanced}, \text{ETF}, \text{REIT}, \text{Commodity}\}$ represent types of investment products offered.  
> Define:  
> $A = \{\text{Equity}, \text{Balanced}, \text{ETF}\}$ - products that include **stocks**.  
> $B = \{\text{Balanced}, \text{ETF}, \text{REIT}\}$ - products with **diversified portfolios**.  
> Then,  
> $A \cap B = \{\text{Balanced}, \text{ETF}\}$ - these are products that **include both stocks and diversification**.


### Union

For two events $A$ and $B$, the **union** $A \cup B$ is the set of outcomes that are in **either** $A$, $B$, or **both**.

> **Example (CAL context):**  
> Let $S = \{\text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}, \text{BB}, \text{B}\}$ represent credit ratings in a bond portfolio.  
> Define:  
> $A = \{\text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}\}$ - **highly rated bonds**  
> $B = \{\text{A}, \text{BBB}, \text{BB}\}$ - **moderately rated bonds**  
> Then,  
> $A \cup B = \{\text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}, \text{BB}\}$ - this is the set of **all bonds that are at least moderately rated**.

---

### Mutually Exclusive Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** (or disjoint) if they cannot occur at the same time. That is, $A \cap B = \emptyset$.

> **Example (CAL context):**  
> Let $S = \{\text{Equity}, \text{Fixed Income}, \text{Commodity}, \text{Real Estate}\}$ represent asset classes.  
> Define:  
> $A = \{\text{Equity}, \text{Fixed Income}\}$ - **liquid asset classes**  
> $B = \{\text{Real Estate}\}$ - **illiquid asset class**  
> Then,  
> $A \cap B = \emptyset$, so $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** because an asset cannot be both liquid and illiquid in this classification.


### Exhaustive Events

A collection of events $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_k$ is called **exhaustive** if their union covers the entire sample space:  
$A_1 \cup A_2 \cup \ldots \cup A_k = S$.

> **Example (CAL context):**  
> Let $S = \{\text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}, \text{BB}, \text{B}\}$ be the set of credit ratings of bonds.  
> Define events based on rating categories:
> - $A_1 = \{\text{AAA}, \text{AA}\}$ - **top-tier investment grade**
> - $A_2 = \{\text{A}, \text{BBB}\}$ - **lower-tier investment grade**
> - $A_3 = \{\text{BB}, \text{B}\}$ - **speculative grade**

Then,  
$A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 = \{\text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}, \text{BB}, \text{B}\} = S$

Thus, the events $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ form an **exhaustive collection** of mutually distinct rating categories in the portfolio.

### Activity 1.6: Credit Rating Events in Portfolio Selection

Let $S = \{ \text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}, \text{BB}, \text{B} \}$ represent the credit ratings assigned to all bonds in a CAL-managed fixed income portfolio.

Suppose the analyst is categorizing bonds for two distinct investment strategies:

- $A$ = bonds eligible for **risk-averse portfolios** = $\{ \text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB} \}$
- $B$ = bonds considered for **high-yield portfolios** = $\{ \text{BBB}, \text{BB}, \text{B} \}$

**Tasks:**

1. Identify $A^c$, the set of bonds **not suitable** for risk-averse portfolios.
2. Determine $A \cap B$, the bonds **common** to both strategies (i.e., flexible candidates).
3. Determine $A \cup B$, the full set of bonds eligible for **either strategy**.
4. Justify whether $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive**.

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

**1. Identify $A^c$**  
$A^c = S \cap A = \{ \text{BB}, \text{B} \}$  
These are bonds **not suitable** for risk-averse portfolios.

---

**2. Determine $A \\cap B$**  
$A \cap B = \{ \text{BBB} \}$  
This bond is a **common candidate** for both strategies.

---

**3. Determine $A \\cup B$**  
$A \cup B = \{ \text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}, \text{BB}, \text{B} \} = S$  
All bonds are considered under at least one strategy.

---

**4. Are $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive?**  
No. Since $A \cap B = \{ \text{BBB} \} \neq \emptyset$, the strategies **share a common bond**, so they are **not mutually exclusive**.

### Activity 1.7: Market Watch Hours

Let $T$ be the number of hours spent by a CAL analyst monitoring market activity in a day. Define:

- $A = \{ T < 2 \}$
- $B = \{ T > 5 \}$

---

**Tasks**

1. Describe $A^c$ in words and using set notation.  
2. Describe $A \cup B$.  
3. Describe $A \cap B$.  
4. Are $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive?

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

**1. Describe $A^c$ in words and using set notation**  
$A^c = \{ T \geq 2 \}$  
This means the analyst watches the market for **2 hours or more**.

---

**2. Describe $A \cup B$**  
$A \cup B = \{ T < 2 \} \cup \{ T > 5 \}$  
This is the event where the analyst spends **less than 2 hours or more than 5 hours** on market monitoring.

---

**3. Describe $A \cap B$**  
$A \cap B = \emptyset$  
There is **no overlap**; one cannot spend time that is both less than 2 hours and more than 5 hours simultaneously.

---

**4. Are $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive?**  
Yes. Since $A \cap B = \emptyset$, the events are **mutually exclusive**.

### Activity 1.8: Investor Response

A client is contacted for investment approval. Let the sample space $S = \{1, 2, 3, \ldots\}$ where each number represents the call on which they responded.

Define:

- $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$
- $B = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$
- $C = \{\text{odd-numbered responses}\} = \{1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots\}$

---

**Tasks**

1. Find $A \cup B$  
2. Find $B \cap C$  
3. Find $A^c$  
4. Is the collection $A, B, C$ exhaustive over $S$?

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

**1. $A \cup B$**  
$A \cup B = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$  
This is the set of responses that occurred on any call from 1 through 6.

---

**2. $B \cap C$**  
$B \cap C = \{3, 5\}$  
These are the responses that occurred on odd-numbered calls within the set $B$.

---

**3. $A^c$**  
$A^c = S \setminus A = \{4, 5, 6, \ldots\}$  
The client did **not** respond on the first three calls.

---

**4. Is the collection $A, B, C$ exhaustive over $S$?**  
No. For a collection to be exhaustive, $A \cup B \cup C$ must equal $S$.  
But $A \cup B \cup C = \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, \ldots\}$ still **misses** some even numbers like 8, 10, etc., not in any event.  
So the collection is **not exhaustive**.
