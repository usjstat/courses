# 1.5 Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is a way to measure the likelihood of an event **when we already know that another event has happened**.

---

## Definition

Let $A$ and $B$ be two events, with $\Pr(B) \ne 0$.

The **conditional probability** of $A$ given $B$ is:

$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)}
$$

This formula tells us how to compute the probability of $A$ **under the condition that $B$ has already occurred.**

---

## Why is it Important?

In real-world situations, we often have **partial information**, and we want to update our probabilities based on that.

### Examples for CAL

- Given that a stock has increased for three consecutive days (event $B$), what is the probability that it will increase again tomorrow (event $A$)?
- Given that a client is from a premium category (event $B$), what is the probability that they prefer a high-risk investment (event $A$)?
- Given that a transaction occurred outside business hours (event $B$), what is the probability it gets flagged for review (event $A$)?

These are all **conditional probability questions**.

---

## Interpretation

- If $\Pr(A \mid B)$ is **close to 1**, then $A$ is **very likely** to occur when $B$ occurs.
- If $\Pr(A \mid B)$ is **close to 0**, then $A$ is **unlikely** given $B$.
- If $\Pr(A \mid B) = \Pr(A)$, then events $A$ and $B$ are **independent**.

---

## Important Notes

- Conditional probability **changes** our perspective - we now **focus only on outcomes where $B$ has occurred**.
- The denominator $\Pr(B)$ must be **greater than zero** for the formula to make sense.

## Activity: Call Centre Probability

A CAL call centre observes the following data over a month:

- 65% of all calls are from **existing clients** (Event $B$).
- 30% of all calls are **escalated** (the process of transferring a customer's call from a frontline agent to a higher-level support representative) to supervisors (Event $A$).
- 20% of all calls are from existing clients **and** are escalated (Event $A \cap B$).



1. What is the probability that a call is escalated **given that** it is from an existing client?
2. What is the probability that a call is from an existing client **given that** it is escalated?

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Let's write the known values:

- $\Pr(B) = 0.65$
- $\Pr(A) = 0.30$
- $\Pr(A \cap B) = 0.20$

**1.** Probability that a call is escalated **given it is from an existing client**:

$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(B)} = \frac{0.20}{0.65} \approx 0.3077
$$

So, about **30.8%** of existing client calls are escalated.

---

**2.** Probability that a call is from an existing client **given it is escalated**:

$$
\Pr(B \mid A) = \frac{\Pr(A \cap B)}{\Pr(A)} = \frac{0.20}{0.30} \approx 0.6667
$$

So, about **66.7%** of escalated calls are from existing clients.

## Activity: Advisor Assignment by ID

In CAL's client management system, there are 5 relationship managers. Three manage **high-net-worth individual (HNWI)** clients (ID: H1, H2, H3), and two manage **corporate clients** (ID: C1, C2). A randomly selected manager is assigned to a new client.

Let:

- $A$: the manager's ID ends in "1"  
- $B$: the manager serves HNWI clients

1. Find $\\Pr(A)$  
2. Find $\\Pr(A \mid B)$

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Total managers = 5  
HNWI: {H1, H2, H3}, Corporate: {C1, C2}

1. Managers with ID ending in "1": H1 and C1 ??? 2  
$$ \Pr(A) = \frac{2}{5} $$

2. Among HNWI: {H1, H2, H3} ??? only H1 ends in 1  
$$ \Pr(A \mid B) = \frac{1}{3} $$

</details>

## Activity: Meeting Scheduling 

At CAL, two advisors are assigned back-to-back consultation slots. There are 3 investment advisors (I1, I2, I3) and 2 compliance advisors (C1, C2). Assume that once an advisor is assigned,  she is not going to the pool again for later assignments.

Let:

- $A$ = first appointment is with an investment advisor  
- $B$ = second appointment is with a compliance advisor

1. Find $\Pr(B \mid A)$  
2. Find $\Pr(B \mid A')$

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Total = 5 advisors

1. If first is investment ??? 2 investment, 2 compliance left  
$$ \Pr(B \mid A) = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 $$

2. If first is compliance ??? 3 investment, 1 compliance left  
$$ \Pr(B \mid A') = \frac{1}{4} = 0.25 $$

</details>

## Activity: Scheduling With Replacement

Same setup as above, but assume advisors return to the pool (with replacement).

1. Find $\Pr(B)$  
2. Find $\Pr(B \mid A)$  
3. Are $A$ and $B$ independent?

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

With replacement:
- $\Pr(A) = \frac{3}{5}$  
- $\Pr(B) = \frac{2}{5}$  
- $\Pr(B \mid A) = \frac{2}{5}$  
??? $\Pr(B \mid A) = \Pr(B)$ ??? **independent**

</details>

## Activity: Internal Bonus Scheme Data

From CAL's HR dashboard:

Let:  
- $C$: staff is a **Clerk**  
- $S_2$: staff is in **Bonus Scheme II**  
- $E$: staff is an **Executive**  
- $S_1$: staff is in **Bonus Scheme I**

1. Find $\Pr(S_2 \mid C)$  
2. Find $\Pr(E \mid S_1)$

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

- Clerks: 170 total, 44 in Scheme II  
$$ \Pr(S_2 \mid C) = \frac{44}{170} \approx 0.2588 $$

- Scheme I: 300 total, 5 are Executives  
$$ \Pr(E \mid S_1) = \frac{5}{300} \approx 0.0167 $$

</details>

## Definition: Independent Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **independent** if:

$$
\Pr(A \mid B) = \Pr(A) \quad \text{or} \quad \Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B)
$$

---

## Activity:  Are Assignments Independent?

At CAL, two advisors are assigned back-to-back consultation slots **without replacement**. There are 3 investment advisors (I1, I2, I3) and 2 compliance advisors (C1, C2).

Let:

- $A$ = first appointment is with an investment advisor  
- $B$ = second appointment is with a compliance advisor

Are assignments independent?

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

- $\Pr(B \mid A) = 0.5$  
- $\Pr(B) = 0.4$  
??? $\Pr(B \mid A) \ne \Pr(B)$ ??? **not independent**

</details>

---

## Mutually Exclusive vs. Independent Events

### Mutually Exclusive
- $\Pr(A \cap B) = 0$  
- $\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B)$

**Example**: A transaction is either **flagged for review** or **cleared** - not both.

### Independent
- $\Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B)$  
- $\Pr(A \mid B) = \Pr(A)$

**Example**: Receiving a **portfolio update email** and a **phone call from your advisor** are independent.

**Note**: Mutually exclusive events with nonzero probabilities are **not independent**.
