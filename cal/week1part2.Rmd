# 1.2 Event Operations

In probability theory, we often combine or relate different events using set operations. These operations help us define more complex events and calculate their probabilities.

### Complement

If $A$ is an event in sample space $S$, the **complement** of $A$, denoted $A'$, $A^c$, or $\\bar{A}$, is the set of outcomes that are in $S$ but **not** in $A$.

> Example: If $S = \\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\\}$ and $A = \\{2, 4, 6\\}$, then $A' = \\{1, 3, 5\\}$.

### Intersection

For two events $A$ and $B$, the **intersection** $A \\cap B$ is the set of outcomes that are in **both** $A$ and $B$.

> Think of this as the overlap between two events.

### Union

For two events $A$ and $B$, the **union** $A \\cup B$ is the set of outcomes that are in **either** $A$ or $B$ or **both**.

### Mutually Exclusive Events

Two events $A$ and $B$ are **mutually exclusive** (or disjoint) if they cannot occur at the same time. That is, $A \\cap B = \\emptyset$.

### Exhaustive Events

A collection of events $A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_k$ is called **exhaustive** if their union covers the entire sample space:  
$A_1 \\cup A_2 \\cup \\ldots \\cup A_k = S$.

### Activity 1.6: Credit Rating Events

Let $S = \{ \text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}, \text{BB}, \text{B} \}$ denote the credit ratings of bonds in a portfolio.

Define the following events:

- $A$ = bonds rated investment grade = $\{\text{AAA}, \text{AA}, \text{A}, \text{BBB}\\}$
- $B$ = bonds rated below A = $\{ \text{BBB}, \text{BB}, \text{B} \}$

**Tasks:**

1. Find $A^c$
2. Find $A \cap B$
3. Find $A \cup B$
4. Are $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive?

### Activity 1.7: Market Watch Hours

Let $T$ be the number of hours spent by a CAL analyst monitoring market activity in a day. Define:

- $A$ = $\{T < 2\}$
- $B$ = $\{T > 5\}$

**Tasks:**

1. Describe $A^c$ in words and using set notation.
2. Describe $A \cup B$.
3. Describe $A \cap B$.
4. Are $A$ and $B$ mutually exclusive?

### Activity 1.8: Investor Response

A client is contacted for investment approval. Let the sample space $S = \\{1, 2, 3, \\ldots\\}$ where each number represents the call on which they responded.

Define:

- $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$
- $B = \{3, 4, 5, 6\}$
- $C = \{ \text{odd-numbered responses} \} = \{1, 3, 5, 7, \ldots\ \}$

**Tasks:**

1. Find $A \cup B$
2. Find $B \cap C$
3. Find $A^c$
4. Is the collection $A, B, C$ exhaustive over $S$?
