# Aim of the Course

This course establishes the fundamentals of probability theory. It supports learning in statistical inference, risk evaluation, actuarial modeling, and various forecasting fields such as weather prediction, sports outcomes, and finance.

| 2 | [Methods for Determining Probability](week2.html) | Classical, relative frequency, axioms, interpretation |
|  | [Conditional Probability](week2part2.html) | Independent events |
| 3 | Probability Rules | Addition, multiplication, total probability, Bayes' theorem |
| 4 | Random Variables | Definitions, discrete and continuous variables |
|  | Events with Random Variables | Event representation |
| 5 | Standard Distributions | Bernoulli, Binomial, Poisson, Uniform, Normal, t, F, exponential |

# Intended Learning Outcomes (ILOs)

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

1.  Describe events using set notation and sample spaces.\
2.  Formulate and identify events of interest.\
3.  Apply classical and empirical methods for calculating probability.\
4.  Explain and apply probability axioms.\
5.  Distinguish conditional from unconditional events.\
6.  Use rules of probability effectively.\
7.  Define and identify types of random variables.\
8.  Relate events to random variables.\
9.  Calculate probabilities and descriptive measures from distributions.
