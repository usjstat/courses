# Random Variables

A random variable provides a convenient and systematic way to represent outcomes of a random experiment as real numbers. It allows us to re-express any event of interest numerically, which greatly simplifies the process of calculating probabilities.
 

This numerical translation enables us to

* **summarise** data with means, variances, and other moments;  
* **derive** probability laws such as the binomial, Poisson, or normal distributions; and  
* **model** real-world uncertainty in fields ranging from finance and engineering to biology and sport.

Throughout this section we will encounter two broad families:

1. **Discrete random variables**, whose ranges are *countable* (e.g., the number of heads in three coin tosses);  
2. **Continuous random variables**, whose ranges contain uncountably many values (e.g., the lifetime of a light bulb measured in hours).


**Definition**  

A *random variable* (r.v.) is a function  
\[
X:\;S \longrightarrow \mathbb{R},
\]  
where $S$ is the sample space of an experiment and $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers.  
A random variable assigns a real number to each outcome $\omega \in S$. This allows us to quantify outcomes in order to analyze probabilities, distributions, and summaries.


### **Experiment**


Toss a (possibly biased) coin **three times** and observe the face-up outcome each time.  
Let the event of interest be the observation of a head (H) on any given toss.  
Denote the probability of observing a head by
\[
\theta = \Pr(\text{Head}).
\]

The sample space is:
\[
S = \{hhh, hht, hth, htt, thh, tht, tth, ttt\}.
\]

Let
\[
X(\omega) = \text{number of heads in } \omega, \quad \omega \in S.
\]
Then $X: S \rightarrow \{0, 1, 2, 3\}$ is a discrete random variable.

---

### **Events in terms of $X$**

Then, the above events can be written in terms of $X$ as follows:

\[
\begin{aligned}
H_0 &= \{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) = 0\} \\
H_1 &= \{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) = 1\} \\
H_2 &= \{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) = 2\} \\
H_3 &= \{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) = 3\} \\
H_4 &= \{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) > 1\}
\end{aligned}
\]

Hence, we can write the probabilities of these events as:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Pr(\{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) = 0\}) &= (1 - \theta)^3 \\
\Pr(\{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) = 1\}) &= 3\theta(1 - \theta)^2 \\
\Pr(\{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) = 2\}) &= 3\theta^2(1 - \theta) \\
\Pr(\{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) = 3\}) &= \theta^3 \\
\Pr(\{\omega \in S \mid X(\omega) > 1\}) &= 3\theta^2(1 - \theta) + \theta^3
\end{aligned}
\]

---

### **Simplified Notation Using $X$**

For convenience, we often omit writing $\omega$ and simply use the shorthand:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Pr(X = 0) &= (1 - \theta)^3 \\
\Pr(X = 1) &= 3\theta(1 - \theta)^2 \\
\Pr(X = 2) &= 3\theta^2(1 - \theta) \\
\Pr(X = 3) &= \theta^3 \\
\Pr(X > 1) &= 3\theta^2(1 - \theta) + \theta^3
\end{aligned}
\]

The first four probabilities follow the **binomial distribution**:

\[
\Pr(X = x) = \binom{3}{x} \theta^x (1 - \theta)^{3 - x}, \quad x = 0,1,2,3.
\]

---

### **Redefinition of $X$ (Omitting $\omega$)**

In practice, we redefine $X$ more intuitively as:
\[
X = \text{the number of heads in three tosses}.
\]

This form omits explicit reference to $\omega$, but the mapping from sample points to numerical outcomes is preserved.


---


### **Experiment**

Consider the experiment of measuring the **lifetime (in hours)** of a randomly selected bulb of a certain kind.

The sample space is:
\[
S = \{\omega \in \mathbb{R} : \omega \ge 0\}.
\]
Each sample point $\omega$ corresponds to the observed lifetime of a bulb.

---

### **Defining the Random Variable**

Let  
\[
T(\omega) = \omega, \quad \omega \in S,
\]
where $T$ is a random variable representing the **lifetime of a randomly selected bulb (in hours)**.

Thus, $T$ maps the sample point (i.e., observed outcome) directly to a numerical value of lifetime.

---

### **Describing Events in terms of the Random Variable**

We define the following events in terms of the random variable $T$:

- $E = \text{the event that the lifetime is exactly 1000 hours}$  
- $F = \text{the event that the lifetime is less than 300 hours}$

These can be expressed as:

\[
\begin{aligned}
E &= \{\omega \in S \mid T(\omega) = 1000\} \\
F &= \{\omega \in S \mid T(\omega) < 300\}
\end{aligned}
\]

Letting  
\[
T = \text{Lifetime of a randomly selected bulb in hours},
\]  
we denote the probabilities of these events as:

\[
\begin{aligned}
\Pr(E) &= \Pr(T = 1000) \\
\Pr(F) &= \Pr(T < 300)
\end{aligned}
\]

---

### **Discussion**

- $T$ is a **continuous random variable** defined on $[0, \infty)$.
- In practical modeling, one may assume that $T \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda)$ or follows another lifetime distribution such as Weibull or Gamma.
- For continuous distributions, $\Pr(T = 1000) = 0$ exactly. However, $\Pr(T < 300)$ may be computed via integration or using the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of $T$.
