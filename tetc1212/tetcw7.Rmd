# Rules of Probability

Probability rules help us combine and manipulate events to calculate desired probabilities.

## Complement Rule

If \( E \) is an event, then:

$$
\Pr(E') = 1 - \Pr(E)
$$

## Addition Rule

For any two events \( A \) and \( B \):

$$
\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B) - \Pr(A \cap B)
$$

If \( A \) and \( B \) are mutually exclusive:

$$
\Pr(A \cup B) = \Pr(A) + \Pr(B)
$$

## Multiplication Rule

For any two events \( A \) and \( B \):

$$
\Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A \mid B) \cdot \Pr(B)
$$

If \( A \) and \( B \) are independent:

$$
\Pr(A \cap B) = \Pr(A) \cdot \Pr(B)
$$

## Activity

Two servers are connected in **series** to handle a critical web application.  

- The **older server** has a probability of 0.05 of going offline during a given hour.  
- The **newer server** has a probability of 0.01 of going offline during the same hour.  

Server failures are independent.  
The system is considered **offline** if **at least one** of the servers goes offline.  


What is the probability that the system will be offline during a given hour?

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Let:

- \( A \): **Older server works**  
  \[
  \Pr(A) = 1 - 0.05 = 0.95
  \]

- \( B \): **Newer server works**  
  \[
  \Pr(B) = 1 - 0.01 = 0.99
  \]

- The **system works** if **both servers work**.

Since failures are independent:

\[
\Pr(\text{System works}) = \Pr(A \cap B) = 0.95 \times 0.99 = 0.9405
\]

Therefore, the probability that the system is **offline** is:

\[
\Pr(\text{System offline}) = 1 - 0.9405 = 0.0595
\]

---

**Final Answer:**  
The probability that the system is offline in a given hour is:

\[
\boxed{5.95\%}
\]

# Law of Total Probability

If \( A_1, A_2, ..., A_n \) are **mutually exclusive and exhaustive** events, and \( B \) is any event:

$$
\Pr(B) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \Pr(B \mid A_i) \cdot \Pr(A_i)
$$

## Activity

A shop sells 3 brands of TVs:

- Brand A (50%), Brand B (30%), Brand C (20%)
- Probability a TV needs repair:
  - A: 0.25
  - B: 0.20
  - C: 0.10

What is the probability that a randomly selected TV will need repair?

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Use total probability:

$$
\Pr(R) = 0.25 \cdot 0.5 + 0.20 \cdot 0.3 + 0.10 \cdot 0.2 = 0.125 + 0.06 + 0.02 = 0.205
$$

## Activity 

A quality control system inspects items on a production line. The probability that a **randomly selected item is faulty** is \( P_1 \). If an item is faulty, there is a probability \( P_2 \) that the defect will be **successfully detected** by the system.

You may assume that:
- Defects are **never detected** in items that are not faulty (i.e., no false positives),
- Each item is inspected **independently**.


1. What is the probability that a **defect is detected** in a randomly selected item?

2. Suppose **three items are selected independently** from the production line.

   (i) What is the probability that **no defects are detected** among the three items?

   (ii) What is the probability that **defects are detected in exactly two items**?

   (iii) What is the probability that **defects are detected in at least two items**?

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Let:
- \( D \): event that a defect is detected

- \( \Pr(D) = P_1 \cdot P_2 \)

- \( \Pr(D^c) = 1 - P_1 \cdot P_2 \): probability that a defect is **not detected**

We compute the probabilities using **basic multiplication rules**.

Let:
- \( d = P_1 \cdot P_2 \)
- \( q = 1 - d \)

---

 (i) No defects are detected in any of the 3 items

This happens when none of the three items show a defect. Each has probability \( q \), so:

\[
\Pr(\text{No detections}) = q \cdot q \cdot q = q^3 = (1 - d)^3
\]

---

 (ii) Defects are detected in **exactly two** items

There are **three different ways** this can happen:

1. First and second items show defect, third does not: \( d \cdot d \cdot q \)
2. First and third items show defect, second does not: \( d \cdot q \cdot d \)
3. Second and third items show defect, first does not: \( q \cdot d \cdot d \)

Add all three possibilities:

\[
\Pr(\text{Exactly two detections}) = d^2 \cdot q + d \cdot q \cdot d + q \cdot d^2 = 3 d^2 q
\]

---

 (iii) At least two detections

This means: **two or three** detections.

We already have:

- \( \Pr(\text{Exactly 2}) = 3 d^2 q \)

Also compute:
- \( \Pr(\text{All 3 detections}) = d \cdot d \cdot d = d^3 \)

So:

\[
\Pr(\text{At least 2 detections}) = 3 d^2 q + d^3
\]

---

 Final Answers

Let \( d = P_1 \cdot P_2 \), \( q = 1 - d \)

- (i) \( \Pr(\text{No detections}) = q^3 = (1 - P_1 P_2)^3 \)
- (ii) \( \Pr(\text{Exactly two detections}) = 3 \cdot (P_1 P_2)^2 \cdot (1 - P_1 P_2) \)
- (iii) \( \Pr(\text{At least two detections}) = 3 \cdot (P_1 P_2)^2 \cdot (1 - P_1 P_2) + (P_1 P_2)^3 \)

# Bayes' Theorem

Let \( A_1, A_2, ..., A_n \) be mutually exclusive and exhaustive events, and \( B \) be an event. Then for any \( A_i \):

$$
\Pr(A_i \mid B) = \frac{\Pr(B \mid A_i) \cdot \Pr(A_i)}{\sum_{j=1}^{n} \Pr(B \mid A_j) \cdot \Pr(A_j)}
$$

This formula allows **reversing conditional probabilities**, moving from \( \Pr(B \mid A_i) \) to \( \Pr(A_i \mid B) \).

## Activity

A company provides 3 health plans to employees:

- Deluxe (D): 30%
- Standard (S): 60%
- Economy (E): 10%

Probability of *no claim*:

- D: 0.1
- S: 0.4
- E: 0.7

1. What is the probability that a randomly selected employee made no claims last year?  
2. If an employee made no claims, what is the probability they were under Standard plan?

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Let \( N \): no claims.

1.  
$$
\Pr(N) = 0.1 \cdot 0.3 + 0.4 \cdot 0.6 + 0.7 \cdot 0.1 = 0.03 + 0.24 + 0.07 = 0.34
$$

2. Use Bayes' Theorem:

$$
\Pr(S \mid N) = \frac{0.4 \cdot 0.6}{0.34} = \frac{0.24}{0.34} \approx 0.7059
$$

## Activity

Initially, a box contains 3 balls identical in all aspects except for their colour, each of which is either white or black. Now, one white ball identical to balls in the box in all aspects except for its colour is added into the box, and then one ball is drawn at random from the box. 

Assuming that the four possible initial compositions of the balls in the box are equally likely, find the probability that:

(i) the ball drawn is white, and  
(ii) initially there were exactly 2 black balls in the box, given that the ball drawn is white.

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

 Step 1: Define Initial Compositions

Let the initial composition of 3 balls be:

- \( H_1 \): 0 black, 3 white  
- \( H_2 \): 1 black, 2 white  
- \( H_3 \): 2 black, 1 white  
- \( H_4 \): 3 black, 0 white  

Each \( H_i \) is equally likely:

$$
\Pr(H_i) = \frac{1}{4} \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, 3, 4
$$

After adding **1 white ball**, the total becomes 4 balls in each case:

- \( H_1 \rightarrow \) 4 white  
- \( H_2 \rightarrow \) 3 white, 1 black  
- \( H_3 \rightarrow \) 2 white, 2 black  
- \( H_4 \rightarrow \) 1 white, 3 black  

Let \( W \): the event that the drawn ball is white.

---

 (i) Find \( \Pr(W) \)

We use the **Law of Total Probability**:

\[
\Pr(W) = \sum_{i=1}^{4} \Pr(W \mid H_i) \cdot \Pr(H_i)
\]

Evaluate:

- \( \Pr(W \mid H_1) = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \)
- \( \Pr(W \mid H_2) = \frac{3}{4} \)
- \( \Pr(W \mid H_3) = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \)
- \( \Pr(W \mid H_4) = \frac{1}{4} \)

Now compute:

\[
\Pr(W) = \frac{1}{4} \cdot 1 + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{2}{4} + \frac{1}{4} \cdot \frac{1}{4}
= \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{16} + \frac{2}{16} + \frac{1}{16} = \frac{4 + 3 + 2 + 1}{16} = \frac{10}{16} = \frac{5}{8}
\]

---

 (ii) Find \( \Pr(H_3 \mid W) \)

We use **Bayes' Theorem**:

\[
\Pr(H_3 \mid W) = \frac{\Pr(W \mid H_3) \cdot \Pr(H_3)}{\Pr(W)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot \frac{1}{4}}{\frac{5}{8}} = \frac{1/8}{5/8} = \frac{1}{5}
\]

## Activity

A cricket selection committee is reviewing 3 different **types of batsmen** from past domestic leagues. Each player has played 3 innings. Based on historical stats, players are classified into four types:

- **Type A**: consistently strong - 3 high scores  
- **Type B**: generally good - 2 high scores, 1 low score  
- **Type C**: inconsistent - 1 high score, 2 low scores  
- **Type D**: struggling - 0 high scores, 3 low scores

The prior probability that a randomly selected player belongs to each type is:

- \( \Pr(A) = 0.15 \), \( \Pr(B) = 0.45 \), \( \Pr(C) = 0.25 \), \( \Pr(D) = 0.15 \)

To simulate pressure scenarios, each player is given **an additional trial innings**, and that trial is automatically considered a **high score**. Then one of the 4 innings is randomly picked to be shown to the selection panel.

Let \( H \): the event that the selected innings is a **high score**.

**Find:**

(i) What is the probability that the selected innings is a high score?  
(ii) If the selected innings is a high score, what is the probability the player originally belonged to Type B?

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Let the types be:

- \( H_1 \): Type A --> becomes 4 high scores  
- \( H_2 \): Type B --> becomes 3 high, 1 low  
- \( H_3 \): Type C --> becomes 2 high, 2 low  
- \( H_4 \): Type D --> becomes 1 high, 3 low

We are given:

- \( \Pr(H_1) = 0.15 \), \( \Pr(H_2) = 0.45 \), \( \Pr(H_3) = 0.25 \), \( \Pr(H_4) = 0.15 \)



 (i) Find \( \Pr(H) \)

Using the **Law of Total Probability**:

\[
\Pr(H) = \sum_{i=1}^{4} \Pr(H \mid H_i) \cdot \Pr(H_i)
\]

- \( \Pr(H \mid H_1) = \frac{4}{4} = 1 \)
- \( \Pr(H \mid H_2) = \frac{3}{4} \)
- \( \Pr(H \mid H_3) = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \)
- \( \Pr(H \mid H_4) = \frac{1}{4} \)

Then,

\[
\Pr(H) = (1 \cdot 0.15) + \left(\frac{3}{4} \cdot 0.45\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} \cdot 0.25\right) + \left(\frac{1}{4} \cdot 0.15\right)
= 0.15 + 0.3375 + 0.125 + 0.0375 = 0.65
\]



 (ii) Find \( \Pr(H_2 \mid H) \)

Apply **Bayes' Theorem**:

\[
\Pr(H_2 \mid H) = \frac{\Pr(H \mid H_2) \cdot \Pr(H_2)}{\Pr(H)} = \frac{0.75 \cdot 0.45}{0.65} = \frac{0.3375}{0.65} \approx 0.5192
\]

## Activity

A box \( B_1 \) contains 2 white balls and 3 black balls which are identical in all aspects except for their colours. 3 balls are transferred at random from box \( B_1 \) into an empty box \( B_2 \). Then a ball is drawn at random from box \( B_2 \).

Find the probability that:

(i) the ball drawn from box \( B_2 \) is white,

(ii) 2 white balls and 1 black ball are transferred from box \( B_1 \) into box \( B_2 \), given that the drawn ball from box \( B_2 \) is white.

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>


Let's denote:
- \( W \): white ball
- \( B \): black ball

Initial contents of \( B_1 \): 2W, 3B  
We transfer 3 balls from \( B_1 \) to \( B_2 \), then draw 1 ball from \( B_2 \).

Let's define all possible combinations of 3-ball transfers from \( B_1 \):

- (3W, 0B): Impossible (only 2W available)
- (2W, 1B): Number of ways = \( \binom{2}{2} \cdot \binom{3}{1} = 1 \cdot 3 = 3 \)
- (1W, 2B): Number of ways = \( \binom{2}{1} \cdot \binom{3}{2} = 2 \cdot 3 = 6 \)
- (0W, 3B): Number of ways = \( \binom{2}{0} \cdot \binom{3}{3} = 1 \cdot 1 = 1 \)

**Total possible transfers:** \( 3 + 6 + 1 = 10 \)

---

 Part (i): Probability that the drawn ball from \( B_2 \) is white

We compute:

\[
\Pr(\text{Draw white}) = \sum \Pr(\text{transfer}) \cdot \Pr(\text{draw white} \mid \text{transfer})
\]

**Case 1: 2W + 1B transferred**
- Probability of this transfer: \( \frac{3}{10} \)
- Probability of drawing white: \( \frac{2}{3} \)

Contribution: \( \frac{3}{10} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{6}{30} \)

**Case 2: 1W + 2B transferred**
- Probability: \( \frac{6}{10} \)
- Drawing white: \( \frac{1}{3} \)

Contribution: \( \frac{6}{10} \cdot \frac{1}{3} = \frac{6}{30} \)

**Case 3: 0W + 3B transferred**
- Probability: \( \frac{1}{10} \)
- Drawing white: \( 0 \)

Contribution: 0

**Total probability:**

\[
\Pr(\text{draw white}) = \frac{6}{30} + \frac{6}{30} = \frac{12}{30} = \boxed{\frac{2}{5}}
\]

---

Part (ii): Probability that 2W + 1B were transferred, **given** that a white ball was drawn

Use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
\Pr(2W1B \mid \text{white drawn}) = \frac{\Pr(2W1B) \cdot \Pr(\text{white} \mid 2W1B)}{\Pr(\text{white})}
= \frac{\frac{3}{10} \cdot \frac{2}{3}}{\frac{2}{5}} = \frac{6}{30} \cdot \frac{5}{2} = \frac{6}{12} = \boxed{\frac{1}{2}}
\]

---

Final Answers:
- (i) \( \Pr(\text{white drawn}) = \frac{2}{5} \)
- (ii) \( \Pr(\text{2W1B} \mid \text{white drawn}) = \frac{1}{2} \)

## Activity 

A bank has **6 pending credit card applications**: **4 are from salaried clients** and **2 are from self-employed clients**. The bank randomly selects **3 applications** to forward to the final approval committee.

From the 3 forwarded applications, one is **randomly chosen** for immediate approval.

---



 Find the probability that:

(i) The selected application is from a **self-employed client**,  
(ii) The forwarded group contained **2 salaried and 1 self-employed** applications, given that the selected application was from a **self-employed client**.

---

<details>
<summary><strong>Solution</strong></summary>

Let:
- SC = Salaried Client
- SE = Self-Employed Client

Initial pool: 4 SC, 2 SE  
We randomly select 3 applications ??? then select 1 from those for approval.

---

 Step 1: List possible 3-applicant transfer combinations

We calculate all valid combinations of 3 applications and count:

- (3SC): \( \binom{4}{3} = 4 \)
- (2SC, 1SE): \( \binom{4}{2} \cdot \binom{2}{1} = 6 \cdot 2 = 12 \)
- (1SC, 2SE): \( \binom{4}{1} \cdot \binom{2}{2} = 4 \cdot 1 = 4 \)

**Total valid groupings** = \( 4 + 12 + 4 = 20 \)

---

 (i) Find \( \Pr(\text{selected application is SE}) \)

Use the Law of Total Probability:

\[
\Pr(\text{SE}) = \sum \Pr(\text{group}) \cdot \Pr(\text{select SE} \mid \text{group})
\]

**Case 1: 3SC**
- Probability of group = \( \frac{4}{20} \), \( \Pr(\text{SE}) = 0 \)

**Case 2: 2SC, 1SE**
- Probability = \( \frac{12}{20} \), \( \Pr(\text{SE}) = \frac{1}{3} \)

**Case 3: 1SC, 2SE**
- Probability = \( \frac{4}{20} \), \( \Pr(\text{SE}) = \frac{2}{3} \)

Total probability:

\[
\Pr(\text{SE}) = \frac{12}{20} \cdot \frac{1}{3} + \frac{4}{20} \cdot \frac{2}{3} = \frac{12}{60} + \frac{8}{60} = \frac{20}{60} = \boxed{\frac{1}{3}}
\]

---

 (ii) Find \( \Pr(2SC1SE \mid \text{selected SE}) \)

Use Bayes' Theorem:

\[
\Pr(2SC1SE \mid \text{SE}) = \frac{\Pr(2SC1SE) \cdot \Pr(\text{SE} \mid 2SC1SE)}{\Pr(\text{SE})}
= \frac{\frac{12}{20} \cdot \frac{1}{3}}{\frac{1}{3}} = \boxed{\frac{12}{20} = \frac{3}{5}}
\]

---

Final Answers:
- (i) Probability that the selected application is from a self-employed client: \( \frac{1}{3} \)
- (ii) Probability that the group had 2 SC and 1 SE, given a self-employed application was selected: \( \frac{3}{5} \)

---

</details>

### Key Points

- Use **Complement Rule** when calculating probability of the event *not happening*
- Use **Addition Rule** to combine probabilities of unions
- Use **Multiplication Rule** to calculate intersections (especially under dependence or independence)
- **Law of Total Probability** helps when an event depends on several underlying scenarios
- **Bayes' Theorem** allows updating beliefs given observed evidence
